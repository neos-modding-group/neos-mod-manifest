# Mod Categories

This is the list of categories that can be used when defining a mod in the [manifest].

If you need a new category or think an existing category should be split let us know with a GitHub issue.

| Category               | Description |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Asset Importing Tweaks |  |
| Bug Workarounds        |  |
| Context Menu Tweaks    |  |
| Dash Tweaks            |  |
| For Mod Developers     | Not intended for non-mod-developer users |
| General Ui Tweaks      |  |
| Hardware Integrations  |  |
| Inspectors             |  |
| Keybinds & Gestures    |  |
| Libraries              | No standalone behavior. Intended to be used by other mods. |
| Logix                  |  |

| Optimization           |  |
| Plugins                | Not mods. Neos plugins require `-LoadAssembly` to work, and normally break multiplayer compatibility. |
| Technical Tweaks       | Lower-level functionality intended for "power users" |
| Visual Tweaks          | Simple modifications to how rendering works |
| Wizards                | A user interface that presents a sequence of dialog boxes that lead the user through a series of well-defined steps |
